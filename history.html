                    <p>Nina was born on February 27, 2005 in Seattle, Washington. Her parents decided to name her Nina because '27' in Japanese sounds similar to Nina. (Hence we celebrate the 27th of each month as Nina day!)</p>

                    <p>Mayuka and Nina. Usually seen as the calm and kind members. Surely nothing can go wrong... right...? Well, not when you add a spice known as Rima :D.
                        "That was LIT", "It passed the vibe check", "I am funny when I am English." These are just some of the incredible quotes left by the wise human known as Nina Hillman on that day, which shall be passed down to future generations.
